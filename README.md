# TypeScript Lab 1: Basic Typing

## Learning Goals

- Write a function with TypeScript 
- Use TypeScript type annotation 

## Introductions to Labs 

Welcome to your first lab in this course! Throughout this course, you will work 
on various assignments as you learn new concepts. 

All assignments are hosted on GitHub. In order to work on them, however, you 
will need to complete work on your local machine. The general process is:

- Click the blue "Fork" button in Canvas (found in the top right corner of the
  assignment)
- Create a personal copy (a 'fork') of the assignment in GitHub
- Download your personal copy (referred to as 'cloning') to your computer
- Complete the required work
- Submit your completed work to Canvas

This process should feel familiar from the prework. With that refresher, let's
get started on your first TypeScript lab. 

## Instructions 

Write a TypeScript function that adds a number of spaces to the front of a
`string`. The signature of the method should be:

```typescript
function prepend(numSpaces: number, inputString: string) {
  // implementation here
}
```
